## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it responsibly.

- Use the **“Report a vulnerability”** button on the repository’s **Security** tab.
- Do **not** use public channels such as Issues, Discussions, or the Wiki to disclose security problems.
- This ensures that reports remain private until a fix is available.

I will acknowledge your report as soon as possible, investigate, and work on a fix.
Responsible disclosure is highly appreciated 🙏.
