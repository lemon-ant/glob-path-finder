> A lightweight Java library for recursive file system traversal with flexible glob pattern filtering.

---

## ✨ Features

- Recursive search starting from any base directory.
- Include and exclude glob patterns.
- Extension filters (case-insensitive).
- Depth limit and symlink following control.
- Option to select only files or include directories.
- Parallel traversal for multiple bases.
- Unique normalized absolute paths as the result.
- **Convenient and flexible interface** — results are fully configurable via `PathQuery`.
- **Optimized performance** — dynamic pipeline construction ensures no unnecessary operations are executed.
- **Professional logging and trace/debug support** — designed for developers to analyze and troubleshoot traversal.

## 📦 Installation

Add to your **Maven** `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lemon-ant</groupId>
  <artifactId>glob-path-finder</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or with **Gradle**:

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.lemon-ant:glob-path-finder:1.0.0'
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Find all files under the current directory

```java
PathQuery query = PathQuery.builder().build();

try (Stream<Path> paths = GlobPathFinder.findPaths(query)) {
    paths.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

### Find only Java files under `src` directory relative to the current directory, excluding tests

```java
PathQuery query = PathQuery.builder()
    .includeGlobs(Set.of("src/**"))
    .excludeGlobs(Set.of("**/test/**"))
    .allowedExtensions(Set.of("java"))
    .onlyFiles(true)        // default is true
    .followLinks(false)     // disable symlink following
    .failFastOnError(false) // shielded mode: errors are logged as WARN, traversal continues
    .build();

try (Stream<Path> paths = GlobPathFinder.findPaths(query)) {
    List<Path> javaFiles = paths.toList();
}
```

## ⚡ Performance and Logging

GlobPathFinder is built with efficiency in mind:

- Dynamic pipeline construction ensures that only the necessary filters and matchers are applied.
- No redundant operations — traversal and filtering remain lightweight even for large trees.
- Professional logging with SLF4J integration:
    - `trace` for deep traversal inspection
    - `debug` for emitted paths and filtering steps

This makes the library not only fast, but also developer-friendly for debugging and analysis.
